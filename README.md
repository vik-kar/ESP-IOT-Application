### ESP32 IoT Framework

**Project Overview:**
This project presents a robust Internet of Things (IoT) framework developed on the ESP32 platform, tailored to demonstrate advanced capabilities in network and device management, data collection, and integration with cloud services. It leverages the powerful features of the ESP32 microcontroller to provide a comprehensive suite of functionalities that cater to modern IoT applications.

**Key Features:**

- **WiFi Connectivity Management**: Implements robust mechanisms for managing WiFi operations, including capabilities for the ESP32 to act as both a station and an access point. The system handles automatic reconnections, credential management, and user-initiated disconnects and resets through physical interactions.

- **HTTP Server and Web Interface**: Features a built-in HTTP server that hosts a web interface for device interaction. This interface allows users to configure device settings, monitor real-time data, and manage device functionalities remotely. It supports OTA firmware updates, providing a mechanism for updating the ESP32's firmware directly through the web interface.

- **Non-Volatile Storage (NVS) Handling**: Utilizes the ESP32’s NVS to store and retrieve configurations across reboots, ensuring device settings like WiFi credentials are preserved. This feature enhances the device's usability in real-world applications where power cycles are common.

- **Time Synchronization**: Integrates SNTP (Simple Network Time Protocol) to ensure the device maintains accurate time, which is critical for logging and scheduling tasks accurately.

- **AWS IoT Integration**: Connects seamlessly with AWS IoT Core to publish and subscribe to MQTT topics, enabling the device to interact with cloud-based services and applications. This integration allows for the remote monitoring and management of device operations and sensor data.

- **Sensor Data Management**: While specific sensors like DHT22 are implied, the framework is designed to be adaptable to various sensors for environmental monitoring or other IoT applications, demonstrating the collection, processing, and dissemination of sensor data.

**Technologies Used:**
- ESP-IDF (Espresso IoT Development Framework)
- MQTT for messaging
- AWS IoT for cloud integration
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the web interface

**Project Significance:**
This project exemplifies the use of embedded systems to create interconnected, easily manageable IoT devices that can be monitored and controlled remotely. It showcases the ESP32’s capabilities in handling multiple tasks such as network management, user interaction through a web server, and real-time data handling, making it an excellent showcase of skill in both software and hardware aspects of IoT development.
